  <h3 class="c">What I Have Learned</h3>
  <p class="c">With my teammates, I have learned that group projects require everyone's approval. I can't just start working; we all have to decide what is best for the project. For example, I can't just change something in a project, because someone else might not like the change. I would never have learned this by myself, because without other people around, I would just work to my liking.</p>
  <h3 class="c">My Future</h3>
  <p class="c">I hope that in the future, I will get accepted into a very good college and I can study computuer science. I want to travel the world and see all of the different parts of humanity. I hope that I will be able to live in a city and be happy.</p>
  <h3 class="c">Advice</h3>
  <p class="c">To other young women skeptical about computer science:<br>I would advise you to give it a shot! Take a class in programming or computer science to see if you like it first. Make sure it's a short class; in case you end up not liking it (which is totally fine!), you can quickly stop. Join a group or watch youtube videos on the topic before fully submerging yourself.</p>
